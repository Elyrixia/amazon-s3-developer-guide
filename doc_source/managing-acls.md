# Managing ACLs<a name="managing-acls"></a>

 There are several ways you can add grants to your resource ACL\. You can use the AWS Management Console, which provides a UI to manage permissions without writing any code\. You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\), REST API, or one of the AWS SDKs\. These libraries further simplify your programming tasks\.
